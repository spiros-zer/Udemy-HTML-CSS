/*
Root element Font size:
Basically what we did here is we wanted to change the  the root element's font size to 10px in order to make the rem-to-pixel calculation easier. But if we set a hardcoded value like 10px then accessibility issues wiull occur (e.g. some user has increased browser font-size but our css will overwrite it). Thus, by using a percentage, the root element's font size will be a percentage of the size set by the user in their browser. The percentage is calculated as shown bellow.
*/
html {
  /*Percentage -> 10px / 16px = 0.625 = 62.5%*/
  /*Percentage of user's browser font-size setting*/

  font-size: 62.5%;
}

body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  line-height: 1;
  font-weight: 400;
  color: #555;
}

/*
max-width:
logic is that if the viewport is bigger than the max-width of the element then the element will have the width specified by max-width. But if the viewport widht is less than the max-width specified then the elemnt will have 100% of the width of the viewport => thus no scroll bars will be displayed.

rem:
it is the root element's font size. The root of the document is the html element and its default font size is 16px. So 1 rem = 16px IF THE HTML FONT SIZE REMAINS THE DEFAULT.
